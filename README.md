#Puppeteer Web Scraping
This is an example Node.js script that uses the Puppeteer library to scrape data from a web page and save it to a JSON file.

#Requirements
Node.js 10 or later
NPM or Yarn
#Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies using NPM or Yarn:

#bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/puppeteer-web-scraping.git
cd puppeteer-web-scraping
npm install
#Usage
To run the script, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch Puppeteer and open the specified web page. The script will then extract the title, URL, and categories of the page, and save them to a JSON file named rectools.json. The script will also take a screenshot of the page and save it to a file named screenshot.png, and generate a PDF of the page and save it to a file named screenshot.pdf.

#Customization
You can modify the script to scrape data from a different web page by changing the URL passed to page.goto(). You can also modify the filename and format of the screenshot and PDF generated by changing the values passed to page.screenshot() and page.pdf().
