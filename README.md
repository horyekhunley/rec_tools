# Puppeteer Web Scraping
- This is an example Node.js script that uses the Puppeteer library to scrape data from a web page and save it to a JSON file.

# Requirements
Node.js 10 or later
NPM or Yarn

# Installation
- Clone the repository and install the dependencies using NPM or Yarn:

# bash

`git clone https://github.com/horyekhunley/rec_tools.git`

`cd puppeteer-web-scraping`

`npm install`

# Usage
- To run the script, use the following command:

`npm start`

- This will launch Puppeteer and open the specified web page. The script will then extract the title, URL, and categories of the page, and save them to a JSON file named rectools.json. The script will also take a screenshot of the page and save it to a file named screenshot.png, and generate a PDF of the page and save it to a file named screenshot.pdf.

# Customization
- You can modify the script to scrape data from a different web page by changing the URL passed to page.goto(). You can also modify the filename and format of the screenshot and PDF generated by changing the values passed to page.screenshot() and page.pdf().
